              Asset data is stored across a range of disparate and inconsistently structured datasets. 
              <br />
            </span>
            <span>
              Each dataset is maintained to different standards. For instance, the parks and reserves dataset is regularly  updated by dedicated resources. The bus shelters dataset hasn’t been updated in the last three years.
              <br />
            </span>
            <span>
              The inconsistent nature of these datasets means they cannot be used to reliably inform long term budget or strategic planning decisions. We think the most valuable datasets (ie. relating to those assets where Council invests the most) are:
              <br />
            </span>
            <span>
              -        Civil Assets (for example roads, paths, drains),
              <br />
            </span>
            <span>
              -        Buildings, and
              <br />
            </span>
            <span>
              -        Sports grounds.
              <br />
            </span>
            <span>
              Because our maturity in analysing data is low, we need some help to identify and capitalise on opportunities.

              Given the purpose of this project is to run a discovery, we do not yet have a backlog of researched and validated user stories. Instead, we have a hypothesis that we can use our data to make better strategic and tactical decisions that save money and make the best use of our limited Council resources.

              We're seeking a data science expert sourced from the Digital Marketplace for 8 weeks with a budget range of $50-75k. During this short term project will run a discovery process to assess the quality of our data and identify opportunities to make better use of our limited resources.
