        Hi 
        <em>
          supplier name
        </em>
         team, We have completed an assessment you requested under 
        <em>
          domain name
        </em>
         to demonstrate the assessment criteria. Assessment result: Not approved This means you are not currently eligible to respond to opportunities in this category.
      </pre>
    </p>
    <b>
      Then the following text will be used:
    </b>
    <textarea
      onChange={[Function]}
      value="Note to Ops team drafter: Delete the dot points that do not apply to this assessment feedback.

The case study did not meet the requirements for the following reason/s:

• The case study provided information on what was done but requires more detail on how it was done. This made it difficult to relate service delivery back to the criteria for this area of expertise.
• The case study did not clearly establish what role the seller had in the outcomes delivered and described in the case study.
• An assessment of the case study and the pricing provided does not indicate value for money to buyers seeking similar services under the Digital Marketplace panel.

We recommend to check the overall quality of your case study prior to resubmitting your case study. Please note: Your case study is open to view when registered government buyers search for suitable sellers for their opportunities."
