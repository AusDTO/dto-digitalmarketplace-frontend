## Command Cheetsheet

A simple list with all the commands you can run.

* `yarn start` - Run the local development server
* `yarn build` - Compile all assets for production
* `yarn build:development` - Compile assets with a watch task
* `yarn test` - Unit tests
* `yarn test:coverage` - Unit tests with coverage reporting
* `yarn server` - Render server in production mode (requires `yarn build`)
* `yarn server:development` Render server in development mode (should be used in tandem with `yarn build:development`)
* `yarn bdd-test` - Integration tests

Or you could look at [package.json](/package.json) scripts. :)
